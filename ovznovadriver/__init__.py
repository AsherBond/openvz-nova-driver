"""
OpenVZ Nova Driver
------------------

This is included in this oddly named directory instead of "nova/virt" since in
the later case it wouldn't be possible to have a setup.py and thus develop on
it at the same time without shadowing the real nova package.

If you don't like that, complain to the Nova core team so they accept this
driver into the actual Nova codebase, or go write a ton of code for libvirt.
